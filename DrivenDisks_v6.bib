  abstract={Starting from a microscopic model of self-propelled hard spheres we use tools of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of hard spheres to derive a Smoluchowski equation for interacting Active Brownian particles. We illustrate the utility of the statistical mechanics framework developed with two applications. First, we derive the steady state pressure of the hard sphere active fluid in terms of the microscopic parameters and second, we identify the critical density for the onset of motility-induced phase separation in this system. We show that both these quantities agree well with overdamped simulations of active Brownian particles with excluded volume interactions given by steeply repulsive potentials. The results presented here can be used to incorporate excluded volume effects in diverse models of self-propelled particles.}

  abstract={In equilibrium, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) expresses the response of an observable to a small perturbation by a correlation function of this variable with another one that is conjugate to the perturbation with respect to energy . For a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), the corresponding FDT is shown to involve in the correlation function a variable that is conjugate with respect to entropy . By splitting up entropy production into one of the system and one of the medium, it is shown that for systems with a genuine equilibrium state the FDT of the NESS differs from its equilibrium form by an additive term involving total entropy production. A related variant of the FDT not requiring explicit knowledge of the stationary state is particularly useful for coupled Langevin systems. The a priori surprising freedom apparently involved in different forms of the FDT in a NESS is clarified.}

                   active Brownian disks take in two dimensions when
                   quenched from the homogeneous suspension to
                   propulsion speeds beyond the binodal. We find the
                   same qualitative behavior for the nucleation rate as
                   a function of density as for a passive suspension
                   undergoing liquid–vapor separation, suggesting that
                   the scenario of an effective free energy also extends
                   to the kinetics of phase separation. We study the
                   transition in more detail through a committor
                   analysis and find that transition states are best
                   described by a combination of cluster size and the
                   radial polarization of particles in the cluster.},

  abstract =      {The theoretical understanding of active matter, which
                   is driven out of equilibrium by directed motion, is
                   still fragmental and model oriented. Stochastic
                   thermodynamics, on the other hand, is a comprehensive
                   theoretical framework for driven systems that allows
                   to define fluctuating work and heat. We apply these
                   definitions to active matter, assuming that
                   dissipation can be modelled by effective
                   non-conservative forces. We show that, through the
                   work, conjugate extensive and intensive observables
                   can be defined even in non-equilibrium steady states
                   lacking a free energy. As an illustration, we derive
                   the expressions for the pressure and interfacial
                   tension of active Brownian particles. The latter
                   becomes negative despite the observed stable phase
                   separation. We discuss this apparent contradiction,
                   highlighting the role of fluctuations, and we offer a

                   detailed balance in the transitions between
                   microscopic configurations. Living systems function
                   out of equilibrium and are characterized by directed
                   fluxes through chemical states, which violate
                   detailed balance at the molecular scale. Here we
                   introduce a method to probe for broken detailed
                   balance and demonstrate how such nonequilibrium

abstract ={Thermal energy agitates all matter, and its competition with ordering tendencies is a fundamental organizing principle in the physical world; this observation suggests that an effective temperature might emerge when external energy input enhances agitation. However, despite the repeated proposal of this concept based on kinetics for various nonequilibrium systems, the value of an effective temperature as a thermodynamic control parameter has been unclear. Here, we introduce a two-component system of driven Janus colloids, such that collisions induced by external energy sources agitate the system, and we demonstrate quantitative agreement with hallmarks of statistical thermodynamics for binary phase behavior: the archetypal phase diagram with equilibrium critical exponents, Gaussian displacement distributions, and even capillarity. The significance is to demonstrate a class of dynamical conditions under which thermodynamic analysis extends quantitatively to systems that are decidedly nonequilibrium except that the effective temperature differs from the physical temperature.},

                   a spatiotemporal pattern mediated by hydrodynamic

                   have been extensively studied as minimal models of
                   many living and synthetic systems from bird flocks to
                   active colloids. However, the influence of active
                   rotations in the absence of self-propulsion (i.e.,
                   spinning without walking) remains less explored.
                   Here, we numerically and theoretically investigate
                   the behavior of ensembles of self-spinning dimers. We
                   find that geometric frustration of dimer rotation by
                   interactions yields spatiotemporal order and active
                   melting with no equilibrium counterparts. At low
                   density, the spinning dimers self-assemble into a
                   triangular lattice with their orientations
                   phase-locked into spatially periodic phases. The
                   phase-locked patterns form dynamical analogs of the
                   ground states of various spin models, transitioning
                   from the three-state Potts antiferromagnet at low
                   densities to the striped herringbone phase of planar
                   quadrupoles at higher densities. As the density is
                   raised further, the competition between active
                   rotations and interactions leads to melting of the
                   active spinner crystal. Emergent edge currents, whose
                   direction is set by the chirality of the active
                   spinning, arise as a nonequilibrium signature of the
                   transition to the active spinner liquid and vanish
                   when the system eventually undergoes kinetic arrest
                   at very high densities. Our findings may be realized
                   in systems ranging from liquid crystal and colloidal
                   experiments to tabletop realizations using
                   macroscopic chiral grains.},

                   forces play in forming the equilibrium structure of a
                   Lennard-Jones liquid are discussed. It is found that
                   the effects of these forces are most easily separated
                   by considering the structure factor (or equivalently,
                   the Fourier transform of the pair-correlation
                   func-tion) rather than the pair-correlation function
                   itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the
                   repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior
                   of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are
                   manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of
                   the structure factor; but this effect decreases as
                   the density increases and is almost negligible at
                   reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions
                   are established by considering the structure factor
                   of a hypothetical reference system in which the
                   intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and
                   identical to the repulsive forces in a Lennard-Jones
                   fluid. This reference system structure factor is
                   calculated with the aid of a simple but accurate
                   approximation described herein. The conclusions lead
                   to a very simple prescription for calculating the

                   is more accurate than that obtained by any previously
                   reported theory. The thermodynamic ramifications of
                   the conclusions are presented in the form of
                   calculations of the free energy, the internal energy
                   (from the energy equation), and the pressure (from

                   formation and phase separation in both biological
                   (e.g., mussel beds) and synthetic (e.g., colloidal
                   swimmers) systems. While these behaviors are
                   increasingly well understood for ensembles of
                   linearly self-propelled "particles", less is known
                   about the collective behaviors of active rotating
                   particles where energy input at the particle level
                   gives rise to rotational particle motion. A recent
                   simulation study revealed that active rotation can
                   induce phase separation in mixtures of
                   counter-rotating particles in 2D. In contrast to that
                   of linearly self-propelled particles, the phase
                   separation of counter-rotating fluids is accompanied
                   by steady convective flows that originate at the
                   fluid-fluid interface. Here, we investigate the
                   influence of these flows on the coarsening dynamics
                   of actively rotating binary liquids using a
                   phenomenological, hydrodynamic model that combines a
                   Cahn-Hilliard equation for the fluid composition with
                   a Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. The
                   effect of active rotation is introduced though an
                   additional force within the Navier-Stokes equations
                   that arises due to gradients in the concentrations of
                   clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating particles.
                   Depending on the strength of active rotation and that
                   of frictional interactions with the stationary
                   surroundings, we observe and explain new dynamical
                   behaviors such as "active coarsening" via
                   self-generated flows as well as the emergence of
                   self-propelled "vortex doublets". We confirm that
                   many of the qualitative behaviors identified by the
                   continuum model can also be found in discrete,
                   particle-based simulations of actively rotating
                   liquids. Our results highlight further opportunities
                   for achieving complex dissipative structures in
                   active materials subject to distributed actuation.},

                   a hard-sphere fluid, it is shown that the model gives
                   the Percus-Yevick theory. With the addition of an
                   attractive tail potential, the mean spherical
                   approximation is obtained. Unlike the random-phase
                   approximation, this appraoch determines the normal
                   modes of the model consistent with the presence of an
                   excluding manifold. The resulting fluid response in
                   the presence of such an object is derived. For a D=1

                   mapping long wavelength density variations onto
                   discrete degrees of freedom. Drawing from studies of
                   surface roughness in lattice models, we account for
                   the resulting nonlinearities simply but accurately.
                   Simulations show that this approach captures complex
                   solvation behaviors quantitatively.},

                   spontaneous orientational order. How do these systems
                   differ from thermal equilibrium systems with such
                   liquid crystalline order? Working with a fluidized
                   monolayer of macroscopic rods in the nematic liquid
                   crystalline phase, we find giant number fluctuations
                   consistent with a standard deviation growing linearly
                   with the mean, in contrast to any situation where the
                   central limit theorem applies. These fluctuations are
                   long-lived, decaying only as a logarithmic function
                   of time. This shows that flocking, coherent motion,
                   and large-scale inhomogeneity can appear in a system
                   in which particles do not communicate except by
                   contact.},

                   flocks of birds are examples of self-organization in

                   self-organization from nonequilibrium driving forces
                   in a suspension of synthetic photoactivated colloidal
                   particles. They lead to two-dimensional "living
                   crystals," which form, break, explode, and re-form
                   elsewhere. The dynamic assembly results from a
                   competition between self-propulsion of particles and
                   an attractive interaction induced respectively by
                   osmotic and phoretic effects and activated by light.
                   We measured a transition from normal to giant-number
                   fluctuations. Our experiments are quantitatively
                   described by simple numerical simulations. We show
                   that the existence of the living crystals is
                   intrinsically related to the out-of-equilibrium
                   collisions of the self-propelled particles.},

  abstract =      {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular
                   dynamics are presented. The first assigns each
                   processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns
                   each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to
                   compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial
                   region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular
                   dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize
                   efficiently—those with short-range forces where the
                   neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be
                   implemented on any distributed-memory parallel
                   machine which allows for message-passing of data
                   between independently executing processors. The
                   algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones
                   benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500
                   to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel
                   supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and
                   Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the
                   fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90
                   algorithm shows that the current generation of
                   parallel machines is competitive with conventional
                   vector supercomputers even for small problems. For
                   large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves
                   parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel
                   Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray
                   C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three
                   algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more
                   complex molecular dynamics simulations are also
                   discussed.},
